        Here are 5 points about lakes:

1. Australia is home to some of the world's most beautiful lakes, including Blue Lake, Dove Lake, Lake Alexandrina, Lake McKenzie, and Lake Albina[1][2].
2. There are not many natural freshwater lakes in Australia due to the lack of glacial or tectonic activity in the country. Most of the lakes in Australia are coastal lakes and lagoons, perched lakes, or salt lakes in the desert regions[3][4].
3. Lake Eyre is the largest lake in Australia, but it is usually dry and only fills with water every eight years[2].
4. Lakes can be artificial or natural. Some of the artificial lakes in Australia include Lake Burley Griffin, Lake Ginninderra, and Cotter Dam[4].
5. Lake Mountain in Victoria, Australia, is a 1,433-metre-high mountain and cross-country ski resort that is known for its picturesque alpine environment[5].
