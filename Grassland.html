        Here are 5 points about Grasslands:

        1. Grasslands are areas dominated by a continuous cover of grasses, found in environments with more rain than deserts but less than forests[1][3].
2. They are home to diverse wildlife, such as kangaroos, emus, ostriches, deer, antelope, rabbits, and prairie dogs in different parts of the world[1][4].
3. Grasslands are known by different names in various regions, such as savannas and veldts in Africa, pampas in South America, and steppes in Europe and Asia[1][4].
4. The Serengeti in Africa is a vast grassland supporting a variety of animals, including zebras, gazelles, wildebeests, cheetahs, lions, and leopards[1][4].
5. Grasslands are agriculturally valuable habitats, filling the ecological niche between forests and deserts[5].
