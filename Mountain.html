        5 points about mountains:

1. Mountains often serve as geographic features that define natural borders of countries. Their height can influence weather patterns, stalling storms that roll off the oceans and squeezing water from the clouds[1].
2. Mountains can be formed through various geological processes, such as tectonic plate collisions, volcanic eruptions, and erosion[4].
3. Mountains can provide valuable resources such as timber, minerals, and fresh water[4].
4. Mountains can support a wide variety of plants and trees, including conifers, oak, chestnut, maple, junipers, stonecrops, campions, mosses, ferns, and climbers[3].
5. Mountains can offer fresh air and scenic beauty to their inhabitants, and some people living in mountainous areas tend to enjoy a longer lifespan[2].
